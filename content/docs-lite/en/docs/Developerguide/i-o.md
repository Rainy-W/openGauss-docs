# I/O<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0289900470"></a>

You can run the  **iostat**  or  **pidstat**  command, or use openGauss health check tools to check the I/O usage and throughput on each node in openGauss and analyze whether performance bottleneck caused by I/O exists.

## Checking I/O Usage<a name="en-us_topic_0283137182_en-us_topic_0237121488_en-us_topic_0073253548_en-us_topic_0040046485_section49799026113827"></a>

Use either of the following methods to check the server I/O:

-   Run the  **iostat**  command to check the I/O usage. This command focuses on the I/O usage and the amount of data read and written on a single hard disk per second.

    ```
    iostat -xm 1  // 1 indicates the interval.
    Device:         rrqm/s   wrqm/s     r/s     w/s    rMB/s    wMB/s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz   await r_await w_await  svctm  %util

    ```

    **rMB/s**  indicates the number of megabytes of data read per second,  **wMB/s**  indicates that of data written per second, and  **%util**  indicates the disk usage.

-   Run the  **pidstat**  command to check the I/O usage. This command focuses on the amount of data read and written on a single process per second.

    ```
    pidstat -d 1 10  // 1 indicates that the query interval is 1 second, and 10 indicates that the number of query times is 10.
    03:17:12 PM   UID       PID   kB_rd/s   kB_wr/s kB_ccwr/s  Command
    03:17:13 PM  1006     36134      0.00  59436.00      0.00  gaussdb
    
    ```

    **kB\_rd/s**  indicates the number of kilobytes of data read per second, and  **kB\_wr/s**  indicates that of data written per second.


## Analyzing Performance Parameters<a name="en-us_topic_0283137182_en-us_topic_0237121488_en-us_topic_0073253548_en-us_topic_0040046485_section401001449238"></a>

1.  Check whether the disk usage exceeds 60%. Disk usage exceeding 60% is called high.

    ```
    df -T
    ```

2.  Perform the following operations to reduce I/O usage if the I/O usage keeps high:
    -   Reduce the number of concurrent tasks.
    -   Do  **VACUUM FULL**  for related tables.

        ```
        vacuum full tablename;
        ```

        >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
        >
        >You are advised to do  **VACUUM FULL**  during the system idle time because this operation will cause heavy I/O load in a short period.  **VACUUM FULL**  during the system busy time does not facilitate the I/O decrease.
