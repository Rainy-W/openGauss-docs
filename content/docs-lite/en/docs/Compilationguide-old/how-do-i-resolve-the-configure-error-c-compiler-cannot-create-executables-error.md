How do I resolve the "Configure error: C compiler cannot create executables" error reported during version build?

Error cause: The  **binarylibs**  file is incomplete or damaged.

Solution: If  **binarylibs**  is built using open-source software, rebuild the open-source third-party software. If  **binarylibs**  is downloaded from code, download the code again. Then run the current script or command again.
