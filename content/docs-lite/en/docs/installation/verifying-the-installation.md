# Verifying the Installation<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0283136489"></a>

Use the  **gs\_om**  tool provided by openGauss to check the database status.

## Prerequisites<a name="en-us_topic_0085434669_section574475764117"></a>

The openGauss database has been installed.

## Procedure<a name="section54111653133815"></a>

1.  Log in to the server as user  **omm**.
2.  Run the following command to check whether the database is normal. If the value of  **cluster\_state**  is  **Normal**, the database is running properly.

    ```
    gs_om -t status
    ```

3.  After the database is installed, a database named  **postgres**  is generated by default. When connecting to a database for the first time, you can connect to this database.

    In the following command,  **postgres**  indicates the name of the database to be connected, and  **26000**  indicates the port number of the primary database node, that is, the value of  **dataPortBase**  in the XML configuration file. Replace the values as required.

    ```
    gsql -d postgres -p 26000
    ```

    If information similar to the following is displayed, the database is successfully connected:

    ```
