# Using gsql to Connect to a Database<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0289900019"></a>

**gsql**  provided by openGauss is a database connection tool running in the CLI.  **gsql**  provides basic and advanced functions of databases to facilitate user operations. This section describes how to use  **gsql**  to connect to a database. For details about how to use  **gsql**, see "Client Tools \> gsql" in  _Tool Reference_.

## Precautions<a name="en-us_topic_0283137029_en-us_topic_0237120292_en-us_topic_0062050379_s8dfe50d001084ac9ad79a79a8f471e8a"></a>

By default, if a client is in idle state after connecting to a database, the client automatically disconnects from the database in the duration specified by  **[session\_timeout](security-and-authentication-(postgresql-conf).md#en-us_topic_0283137371_en-us_topic_0237124696_en-us_topic_0059778664_see4820fb6c024e0aa4c56882aeae204a)**. To disable the timeout setting, set  **[session\_timeout](security-and-authentication-(postgresql-conf).md#en-us_topic_0283137371_en-us_topic_0237124696_en-us_topic_0059778664_see4820fb6c024e0aa4c56882aeae204a)**  to  **0**.

Connection information has been confirmed. For details, see  [Confirming Connection Information](confirming-connection-information.md).

## Procedure<a name="en-us_topic_0283137029_en-us_topic_0237120292_en-us_topic_0062050379_sedb32189b5a4410a9a8ac8586f1766a0"></a>

1.  Log in as the OS user  **omm**  to the primary node of the database.
2.  Connect to a database.

    After the database is installed, a database named  **postgres**  is generated by default. When connecting to a database for the first time, you can connect to this database.

    Run the following command to connect to the database:

    ```
    gsql -d postgres -p 8000
    ```

    **postgres**  is the name of the database to be connected, and  **8000**  is the port number of the primary database node. Replace the values as required. You can also run either of the following commands to connect to the database:

    ```
    gsql postgres://omm:Gauss_234@127.0.0.1:8000/postgres -r
    gsql -d "host=127.0.0.1 port=8000 dbname=postgres user=omm password=Gauss_234"
    ```

    If information similar to the following is displayed, the connection succeeds:

    ```
    gsql((openGauss x.x.x build f521c606) compiled at 2021-09-16 14:55:22 commit 2935 last mr 6385 release)
    Non-SSL connection (SSL connection is recommended when requiring high-security)
    Type "help" for help.
    
    openGauss=# 
    ```

    User  **omm**  is the administrator, and  **DBNAME=\#**  is displayed. If you log in to and connect to the database as a common user,  **DBNAME=\>**  is displayed.

    **Non-SSL connection**  indicates that the database is not connected in SSL mode. If high security is required,  [connect to the database in SSL mode](establishing-secure-tcp-ip-connections-in-ssl-mode.md).

3.  You are advised to change the password upon the first login. The command is as follows:

    ```
    openGauss=# ALTER ROLE omm IDENTIFIED BY 'XXXXXXXX' REPLACE 'XXXXXXXX';
    ```

4.  Exit the database.

    ```
    openGauss=# \q
    ```


## Remotely Connecting to a Database<a name="en-us_topic_0283137029_en-us_topic_0237120292_en-us_topic_0062050379_section435356016419"></a>

1.  Configure the remote connection. For details, see  [Configuring Remote Connection](configuring-remote-connection.md).
2.  On the host \(whose IP address is 10.10.0.30\) where the client resides, upload the client tool package and configure  **gsql**  environment variables. The openEuler environment is used as an example.
    1.  Log in to the host where the client resides as user  **root**.
    2.  Run the following command to create the  **/tmp/tools**  directory:

        ```
        mkdir /tmp/tools
        ```

    3.  Obtain  **openGauss-X.X.X-openEuler-64bit-Libpq.tar.gz**  from the  software installation package  and upload it to the  **/tmp/tools**  directory.

        >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
        >-   The software package is located where you put it before installation. Set it based on site requirements.
        >-   The tool package name may vary in different OSs. Select the tool package suitable for your OS.

    4.  Run the following commands to decompress the package:

        ```
        cd /tmp/tools
        tar -zxvf openGauss-X.X.X-openEuler-64bit-Libpq.tar.gz
        ```

    5.  Log in to the server where the primary database node is located, and copy the  **bin**  directory in the database installation directory to  **/tmp/tools**  on the client host.

        ```
        scp -r /opt/huawei/install/app/bin root@10.10.0.30:/tmp/tools
        ```

        In the preceding command,  **/opt/huawei/install/app**  indicates the  _\{gaussdbAppPath\}_  path configured during installation, and  **10.10.0.30**  indicates the IP address of the client host.

    6.  Log in to the host where the client is installed and set environment variables.

        Run the following command to open the  **\~/.bashrc**  file:

        ```
        vi ~/.bashrc
        ```

        Enter the following content and run  **:wq!**  to save and exit.

        ```
        export PATH=/tmp/tools/bin:$PATH
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/tools/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        ```

    7.  Run the following command to make the environment variables take effect:

        ```
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```

3.  Connect to a database.

    After the database is installed, a database named  **postgres**  is generated by default. When connecting to a database for the first time, you can connect to this database.

    ```
    gsql -d postgres -h 10.10.0.11 -U jack -p 8000
    Password for user jack:
    ```

    **postgres**  is the name of the database,  **10.10.0.11**  is the IP address of the server where the primary node of the database resides,  **jack**  is the user for connecting to the database, and  **8000**  is the port number of the database primary node.

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
    >-   If a machine connected to openGauss is not in the same network segment as openGauss, the IP address specified by  **-h**  should be the value of  **coo.cooListenIp2**  \(application access IP address\) set in Manager.
    >-   Do not remotely connect to the database as user  **omm**.
