GAUSS-52600: "Can not obtain any cluster ring."

SQLSTATE: None

Description: Failed to obtain a ring from the database.

Solution: Check whether the node information in the XML file is correctly configured.

GAUSS-52601: "Redistribution failed due to user request."

SQLSTATE: None

Description: Redistribution failed due to user requests.

Solution: Check whether users have performed invalid operations during the scale-in or scale-out process.

GAUSS-52604: " Parameter '-r'\[%s\] can not be more than the numbers of cluster ring\[%s\]."

SQLSTATE: None

Description: The number of the  **-r**  parameters cannot exceed that of the database rings.

Solution: Check whether the number of the  **-r**  parameters in the  **gs\_shrink**  command exceeds that of database rings configured in the XML file.

GAUSS-52605: "Can not contract local node\(%s\). "

SQLSTATE: None

Description: The local node cannot be scaled in.

Solution: Ensure that the node where the scale-in command is executed has been configured in the XML.

GAUSS-52606: " Contract too many nodes. It should left three nodes to format a cluster at least."

SQLSTATE: None

Description: Too many nodes are scaled in. Retain at least three nodes in the database after scale-in.

Solution: Check whether the number of database nodes in the XML file after the scale-in is smaller than three.

GAUSS-52607: " \[%s\] does not at the end of instance list."

SQLSTATE: None

Description: The node is not at the end of the instance list.

Solution: Check whether the scale-in nodes configured in the XML file are the nodes at the end of the database in sequence.

GAUSS-52609: " All contracted nodes do not contain DN instance."

SQLSTATE: None

Description: All the scale-in nodes cannot contain DNs.

Solution: Check whether the scale-in nodes in the XML file contain DNs.

GAUSS-52612: " All dilatation nodes do not contain the DN instance."

SQLSTATE: None

Description: All the scale-out nodes cannot contain DNs.

Solution: Check whether the scale-out nodes in the XML file contain DNs.

GAUSS-52613: " Static configuration is not matched on some nodes. Please handle it first."

SQLSTATE: None

Description: The static configuration file on the node does not match the new XML file.

Solution: Check whether the XML file is correctly configured. If not, modify the XML file and run the pre-processing script again.

GAUSS-52614: "Timeout. The current cluster status is %s."

SQLSTATE: None

Description: Timeout occurred.

Solution: Perform the operation again.

GAUSS-52615: "Cluster lock unlocked due to timeout. "

SQLSTATE: None

Description: Failed to unlock the database due to timeout.

Solution: Check whether the database is normal. Check whether the database can write data. View corresponding logs and detailed error information.

GAUSS-52616: "Can not find a similar instance for \[%s %s\]. "

SQLSTATE: None

Description: A similar instance \[the host name and instance directory\] cannot be found.

Solution: Check whether the database is normal and whether the node information in the XML file is correctly configured.

GAUSS-52617: "Invalid check type. "

SQLSTATE: None

Description: The check type is invalid.

Solution: Ensure that the check types of the node groups in the scale-in module are precheck and postcheck. Other check types are incorrect.

GAUSS-52619: "Failed to uninstall application."

SQLSTATE: None

Description: Failed to uninstall the application.

Solution: Perform the operation again.

GAUSS-52620: " Not all nodes found. The following is what we found: %s."

SQLSTATE: None

Description: Failed to find all nodes. The nodes that we found are as follows:

Solution: Check whether the database is normal and whether the configured scale-in node in the XML file is correct.

GAUSS-52621: " No DNs specified in target create new group."

SQLSTATE: None

Description: No DN is available when you create a node group.

Solution: Check and determine whether the DN configured on the node is normal when you scale in a module and create a node group.

GAUSS-52622: " No new group name specified in target create new group."

SQLSTATE: None

Description: No node group name is available when you create a node group.

Solution: The node group name is empty when you scale in a module and create a node group. Check whether the new node group name is correct. The new node group name value is  **group\_version2**  or  **group\_version1**.

GAUSS-52625: "The local instance and peer instance does not both in contracted nodes. "

SQLSTATE: None

Description: The local instance and the peer instance are not located on the same scale-in node.

Solution: Check whether the scale-in nodes are formed into a ring.

GAUSS-52627: " The current cluster is locked."

SQLSTATE: None

Description: The database is locked.

Solution: In the scale-out module, the old node database has been locked. Unlock it and continue scaling out the current database.

GAUSS-52628: "Static configuration has already been updated on all nodes, expansion has been completed possibly. "

SQLSTATE: None

Description: The static configuration file has been updated on each node. The scale-out is probably complete.

Solution: Check whether the database is normal after the scale-out. If the database includes the scale-out nodes and the database is normal, do not execute any scale-out commands anymore.

GAUSS-52629: "Cluster ring\(%s\) can not obtain less than three nodes. "

SQLSTATE: None

Description: The number of database rings cannot be less than three.

Solution: Check the XML file configuration in the scale-in scenario to see whether the number of scale-in nodes to be executed is smaller than three.

GAUSS-52630: "Failed to set the read-only mode parameter for all DN instances. "

SQLSTATE: None

Description: Failed to set the read-only mode for all DNs.

Solution: Ensure that  **gs\_guc**  exists and that the database is normal. Reset the read-only mode again.

GAUSS-52632: "Cluster breakdown or abnormal operation during expanding online, lock process for expansion is lost."

SQLSTATE: None

Description:Internal system error.

Solution:Contact technical support.

GAUSS-52633: "Can not excute redistribution for shrink excuted failed."

SQLSTATE: None

Description:Internal system error.

Solution:Contact technical support.

GAUSS-52634: "Redis table record count cannot be more than %d."

SQLSTATE: None

Description:Internal system error.

Solution:Contact technical support.
