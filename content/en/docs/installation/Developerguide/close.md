-   After a cursor is closed, no subsequent operations are allowed on it.
-   A cursor should be closed when it is no longer needed.
-   Every non-holdable open cursor is implicitly closed when a transaction is terminated by  **COMMIT**  or  **ROLLBACK**.
-   A holdable cursor is implicitly closed if the transaction that created it aborts by  **ROLLBACK**.
-   If the cursor creation transaction is successfully committed, the holdable cursor remains open until an explicit  **CLOSE**  operation is executed, or the client disconnects.
-   openGauss does not have an explicit  **OPEN**  cursor statement. A cursor is considered open when it is declared. You can view all available cursors by querying the  **pg\_cursors**  system view.
