# Development Based on libpq<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0244721240"></a>

openGauss does not verify the use of libpq interfaces in application development. You are not advised to use this set of interfaces for application development, because underlying risks probably exist. You can use the ODBC or JDBC interface instead.
