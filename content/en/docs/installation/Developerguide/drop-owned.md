-   This interface will revoke the role's permissions on all objects in the current database and shared objects \(databases and tablespaces\).
-   **DROP OWNED**  is often used to prepare for removing one or more roles. Because  **DROP OWNED**  affects only the objects in the current database, you need to run this statement in each database that contains the objects owned by the role to be removed.
-   Using the  **CASCADE**  option may cause this statement to recursively remove objects owned by other users.
-   The databases and tablespaces owned by the role will not be removed.
