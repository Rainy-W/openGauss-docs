# Standard SQL<a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0252569320"></a>

The openGauss database supports standard SQL statements. The SQL standard is an international standard and is updated periodically. SQL standards are classified into core features and optional features. Most databases do not fully support SQL standards. SQL features are built by database vendors to maintain customers and push up application migration costs. New SQL features are increasingly different among vendors. Currently, there is no authoritative SQL standard test.

The openGauss database supports most of the core features of SQL:2011 and some optional features. For details about the features, see the  _openGauss Product Documentation_.

The use of standard SQL allows all database vendors to use a unified SQL interface, reduce the cost of language learning and application migration.
