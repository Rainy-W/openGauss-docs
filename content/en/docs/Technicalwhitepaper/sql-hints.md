# SQL Hints<a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0252569345"></a>

SQL hints are supported, which can override any execution plan and thus improve SQL query performance.

In plan hints, you can specify a join order; join, stream, and scan operations; and the number of rows in a result to tune an execution plan, improving query performance.
