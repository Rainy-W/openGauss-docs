# Standalone Deployment<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0251307666"></a>

The standalone deployment does not ensure reliability or availability. There is only one data copy. If data is damaged or lost, data can be restored only through physical backup. Therefore, this deployment mode applies to scenarios such as experiencing databases and commissioning syntax functions in the test environment. You are not advised to use this mode on the commercial live network.
