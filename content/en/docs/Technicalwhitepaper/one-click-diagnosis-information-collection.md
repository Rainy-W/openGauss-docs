# One-Click Diagnosis Information Collection<a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0252569390"></a>

Multiple suites are provided to capture, collect, and analyze diagnosis data, enabling fault diagnosis and accelerating the diagnosis process. Necessary database logs, cluster management logs, and stack information can be extracted from the production environment based on the requirements of development and fault locating personnel. Fault locating personnel demarcate and locate faults based on the obtained information.

The one-click collection tool obtains different information from the production environment depending on the actual faults, improving the fault locating and demarcation efficiency. You can modify the configuration file to collect the required information:

-   OS information by running Linux commands
-   Database information by querying system catalogs or views
-   Run logs of the database system and logs related to cluster management
-   Database system configuration information
-   Core files generated by database-related processes
-   Stack information about database-related processes
-   Trace information generated by the database process
-   Redo log file XLOG generated by the database
