Create the  **customer\_t1\_bak**  table whose structure and data are the same as those of the  **customer\_t1**  table.

```
openGauss=# CREATE TABLE customer_t1_bak AS TABLE customer_t1;
INSERT 0 9
```

The  **customer\_t1\_bak**  table is created, and the data in the table is as follows:

```
openGauss=# SELECT * FROM customer_t1_bak;
 c_customer_sk | c_customer_id | c_first_name | c_last_name | amount
---------------+---------------+--------------+-------------+--------
          3869 | hello         | Grace        |             |   1000
          3869 | hello         | Grace        |             |   1000
          3869 |               | Grace        |             |
          3869 | hello         |              |             |
          3869 | hello         |              |             |
               |               |              |             |
          6985 | maps          | Joes         |             |   2200
          9976 | world         | James        |             |   5000
          4421 | Admin         | Local        |             |   3000
(9 rows)
```

Run the following statement to delete the employee whose  **c\_customer\_sk**  is set to  **3869**  from the  **customer\_t1\_bak**  table:

```
openGauss=# DELETE FROM customer_t1_bak WHERE c_customer_sk = 3869;
DELETE 5
```

The following information is displayed, indicating that the row where  **c\_customer\_sk**  is set to  **3869**  has been deleted.

```
openGauss=# SELECT * FROM customer_t1_bak;
 c_customer_sk | c_customer_id | c_first_name | c_last_name | amount
---------------+---------------+--------------+-------------+--------
               |               |              |             |
          6985 | maps          | Joes         |             |   2200
          9976 | world         | James        |             |   5000
          4421 | Admin         | Local        |             |   3000
(4 rows)
```

If the WHERE statement is not specified, the data of the entire table is deleted by default, and only the table structure is retained.

```
openGauss=# DELETE FROM customer_t1_bak;
DELETE 4
```

The result is as follows:

```
openGauss=# SELECT * FROM customer_t1_bak;
 c_customer_sk | c_customer_id | c_first_name | c_last_name | amount
---------------+---------------+--------------+-------------+--------
(0 rows)
```
