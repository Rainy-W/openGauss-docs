[Operators](operators.md)  lists the common comparative operators.

In addition to comparative operators, you can also use the following sentence structure:

-   BETWEEN operator

    **a  BETWEEN  x  AND  y**  is equivalent to  **a \>= x AND a <= y**.

    **a  NOT BETWEEN  x  AND y**  is equivalent to  **a < x OR a \> y**.

-   To check whether a value is null, use:

    expression IS NULL

    expression IS NOT NULL

    or an equivalent \(non-standard\) sentence structure:

    expression   ISNULL

    expression  NOTNULL

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:** 
    >Do not write  **expression=NULL**  or  **expression<\>\(!=\)NULL**, because  **NULL**  represents an unknown value, and these expressions cannot determine whether two unknown values are equal.


-   is distinct from/is not distinct from
    -   is distinct from

        If the data types and values of A and B are different, the value is  **true**.

        If the data types and values of A and B are the same, the value is  **false**.

        Empty values are considered the same.

    -   is not distinct from

        If the data types and values of A and B are different, the value is  **false**.

        If the data types and values of A and B are the same, the value is  **true**.

        Empty values are considered the same.



## Pseudocolumn<a name="en-us_topic_0283137643_section104921036122717"></a>

ROWNUM

**ROWNUM**  is a pseudocolumn that returns a number indicating the row number of the result obtained from the query. The value of  **ROWNUM**  in the first row is  **1**, the value of  **ROWNUM**  in the second row is  **2**, and so on.

The return type of  **ROWNUM**  is numeric.  **ROWNUM**  can be used to limit the total number of rows returned by a query. For example, the following statement limits the maximum number of records returned from the table  **Students**  to 10.

```
select * from Students where rownum <= 10;
```
