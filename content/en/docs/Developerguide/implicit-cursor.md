# Implicit Cursor<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0245374635"></a>

Implicit cursors are automatically set by the system for non-query statements such as modify or delete operations, along with their workspace. Implicit cursors are named  **SQL**, which is defined by the system.

## Overview<a name="en-us_topic_0237122245_en-us_topic_0059778352_s2cdd131c90024828a55b72311ceb5476"></a>

Implicit cursor operations, such as definition, open, value-grant, and close operations, are automatically performed by the system and do not need users to process. Users can use only attributes related to implicit cursors to complete operations. In workspace of implicit cursors, the data of the latest SQL statement is stored and is not related to explicit cursors defined by users.

Format call:  **SQL%**

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>**INSERT**,  **UPDATE**,  **DELETE**, and  **SELECT**  statements do not need defined cursors.  

## Attributes<a name="en-us_topic_0237122245_en-us_topic_0059778352_sbc470b788a0c40af9e3f1dcf2d963894"></a>

An implicit cursor has the following attributes:

-   **SQL%FOUND**: Boolean attribute, which returns  **TRUE**  if the last fetch returns a row.
-   **SQL%NOTFOUND**: Boolean attribute, which works opposite to the  **SQL%FOUND**  attribute.
-   **SQL%ROWCOUNT**: numeric attribute, which returns the number of records fetched from the cursor.
-   **SQL%ISOPEN**: Boolean attribute, whose value is always  **FALSE**. Close implicit cursors immediately after an SQL statement is run.
