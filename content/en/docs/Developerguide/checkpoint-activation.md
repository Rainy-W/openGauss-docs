# Checkpoint Activation<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0260488176"></a>

MOT checkpoints are integrated into the envelope's checkpoint mechanism. The process can be triggered manually by executing “**CHECKPOINT;**” command or by automatically considering the envelope's triggering settings \(time/size\).

Checkpoint configuration is done in the mot.conf file – see the relevant  [Default MOT.conf](default-mot-conf.md). ++
