MOT records statistics and error messages in the same log file as openGauss. MOT commits a log record of the transaction changes as each transaction ends, as described in the  [Logging](en-us_topic_0257713267.md#logging_1)  section.

-   For an overview of MOT logging and general persistence features, see the  [Logging](en-us_topic_0257713267.md#logging_1)  section.
