# Using MOT<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0270171531"></a>

This chapter describes how to deploy, use and manage openGauss MOT. Using MOT tables is quite simple. The syntax of all MOT commands is the same as for openGauss disk‑based tables. Only the create and drop table statements in MOT differ from the statements for disk-based tables in openGauss. You may refer to this chapter in order to learn how to get started, how to convert a disk‑based table into an MOT table, how to use advanced MOT features, such as Native Compilation (JIT) for Queries and Stored Procedures, execution of Cross-engine Transactions, as well as MOT's limitations and coverage. MOT administration options are also described here. This chapter also describes how to perform a TPC-C benchmark.
