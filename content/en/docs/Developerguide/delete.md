**DELETE**  deletes rows that satisfy the  **WHERE**  clause from the specified table. If the  **WHERE**  clause is absent, the effect is to delete all rows in the table. The result is a valid, but an empty table.

-   You must have the  **DELETE**  permission on the table to delete from it, as well as the  **SELECT**  permission for any table in the  **USING**  clause or whose values are read in the  **condition**.
-   For column-store tables, the  **RETURNING**  clause is currently not supported.

## Parameter Description<a name="en-us_topic_0237122131_en-us_topic_0059778379_s6df87c0dd87c49e29a034e0ff3385ca6"></a>

-   **WITH \[ RECURSIVE \] with\_query \[, ...\]**

    Specifies one or more subqueries that can be referenced by name in the main query, which is equivalent to a temporary table.

    If  **RECURSIVE**  is specified, it allows a  **SELECT**  subquery to reference itself by name.

    Format of  **with\_query**:
    ```

    with\_query\_name \[ \( column\_name \[, ...\] \) \] AS

    \( \{select | values | insert | update | delete\} \)
    ```

    + **with\_query\_name**  specifies the name of the result set generated by a subquery. Such names can be used to access the subquery result set.

    +  **column\_name**  specifies the column name displayed in the subquery result set.

    + Each subquery can be a  **SELECT**,  **VALUES**,  **INSERT**,  **UPDATE**  or  **DELETE**  statement.

-   **ONLY**

    If  **ONLY**  is specified before the table name, matching rows are deleted from the named table only. If  **ONLY**  is not specified, matching rows are also deleted from any tables inheriting from the named table.

-   **table\_name**

    Specifies the name \(optionally schema-qualified\) of the target table.

    Value range: an existing table name

-   **alias**

    Specifies a substitute name for the target table.

    Value range: a string. It must comply with the naming convention rule.

-   **using\_list**

    Specifies the  **USING**  clause.

-   **condition**

    Specifies an expression that returns a Boolean value. Only rows for which this expression returns  **true**  will be deleted.

-   **WHERE CURRENT OF cursor\_name**

    This parameter is reserved.

-   **output\_expr**

    Specifies an expression to be computed and returned by the  **DELETE**  statement after each row is deleted. The expression can use any column names of the table. Write  **\***  to return all columns.

-   **output\_name**

    Specifies a name to use for a returned column.

    Value range: a string. It must comply with the naming convention rule.
