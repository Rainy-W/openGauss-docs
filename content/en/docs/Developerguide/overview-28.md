To properly define a table, you must:

1.  **Reduce the data volume scanned**  by using the partition pruning mechanism.
2.  **Minimize random I/Os**  by using clustering or partial clustering.

The table definition is created during the database design and is reviewed and modified during the SQL statement optimization.
