# ARM/Kunpeng 2-Socket 128 Cores<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0260488051"></a>

Two types of tests were performed – Single Node \(without HA\) and Primary/Secondary \(with HA\).

-   Performance

![](figures/en-us_image_0260488263.png)

As seen in the Figure above, in MOT the replication overhead of a Primary/Secondary High Availability scenario is 7% on ARM/Kunpeng and 2% on x86 servers, as opposed to the overhead in Disk-tables of 20% on ARM/Kunpeng and 15% on x86 servers.

-   Performance per CPU core
