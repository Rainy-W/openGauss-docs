Fast-refresh materialized views can be incrementally refreshed. You need to manually execute statements to incrementally refresh materialized views in a period of time. The difference between the incremental and the full materialized views is that the fast-refresh materialized view supports only a small number of scenarios. Currently, only base table scanning statements or UNION ALL can be used to create materialized views.
