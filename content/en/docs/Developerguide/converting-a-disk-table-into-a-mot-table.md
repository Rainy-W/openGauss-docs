# Converting a Disk Table into a MOT Table<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0257867381"></a>

The direct conversion of disk tables into MOT tables is not yet possible, meaning that no ALTER TABLE statement yet exists that converts a disk-based table into a MOT table.

The following describes how to manually perform a few steps in order to convert a disk-based table into a MOT table, as well as how the  **gs\_dump**  tool is used to export data and the  **gs\_restore **tool is used to import data.
