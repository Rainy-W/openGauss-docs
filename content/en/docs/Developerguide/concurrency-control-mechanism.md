# Concurrency Control Mechanism<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0260488146"></a>

After investing extensive research to find the best concurrency control mechanism, we concluded that SILO[\[5\]](#_ftn5)-based on OCC is the best ACID-compliant OCC algorithm for MOT. SILO provides the best foundation for MOTâ€™s challenging requirements.

>MOT is fully Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability \(ACID\)-compliant, as described in the ++ section.
