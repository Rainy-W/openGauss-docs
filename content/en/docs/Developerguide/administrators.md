## Initial Users<a name="en-us_topic_0237121100_section41994915210"></a>

The account automatically generated during openGauss installation is called an initial user. An initial user is the system, monitoring, O&M, and security policy administrator who has the highest-level permissions in the system and can perform all operations. The username is the same as the name of the OS user who installs openGaussï¼Œplease refer to the *Installation Guide* for detail.

An initial user bypasses all permission checks. You are advised to use an initial user as a database administrator only for database management other than service running.

## System Administrators<a name="en-us_topic_0237121100_section441452135814"></a>

A system administrator is an account with the  **SYSADMIN**  attribute. By default, a database system administrator has the same permissions as object owners but does not have the object permissions in  **dbe\_perf**  mode.

To create a system administrator, connect to the database as the initial user or a system administrator and run the  **[CREATE USER](create-user.md)**  or  **[ALTER USER](alter-user.md)**  statement with  **SYSADMIN**  specified.

```
postgres=# CREATE USER sysadmin WITH SYSADMIN password "Bigdata@123";
```

or

```
postgres=# ALTER USER joe SYSADMIN;
```

To run the  **ALTER USER**  statement, the user must exist.

## Monitoring Administrators<a name="en-us_topic_0237121100_section4709123485918"></a>

A monitoring administrator is an account with the  **MONADMIN**  attribute and has the permissions to query views and functions in  **dbe\_perf**  mode. A monitoring administrator can also grant or revoke object permissions in  **dbe\_perf**  mode.

To create a monitoring administrator, connect to the database as the initial user and run the  **[CREATE USER](create-user.md)**  or  **[ALTER USER](alter-user.md)**  statement with  **MONADMIN**  specified.

```
postgres=# CREATE USER monadmin WITH MONADMIN password "Bigdata@123";
```

or

```
postgres=# ALTER USER joe MONADMIN;
```

To run the  **ALTER USER**  statement, the user must exist.
