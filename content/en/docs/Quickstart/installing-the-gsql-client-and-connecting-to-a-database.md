# Installing the gsql Client and Connecting to a Database<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0241704257"></a>

**gsql**  is an openGauss-provided database connection tool running in the CLI.  **gsql**  provides basic and advanced functions of databases to facilitate user operations. This section describes how to install the  **gsql**  client and use it to connect to a database. For more configurations, see the openGauss product documentation.

## Prerequisites<a name="en-us_topic_0241234230_en-us_topic_0085434651_en-us_topic_0059781996_en-us_topic_0062050379_section2863008216400"></a>

Connection information has been confirmed. For details, see  [Confirming Connection Information](en-us_topic_0242370176.md).

## Procedure<a name="en-us_topic_0241234233_section428894161117"></a>

On the host, upload the client tool package and configure environment variables for the  **gsql**  client.

1.  Log in to the host where the client resides as user  **root**.
2.  Run the following command to create the  **/tmp/tools**  directory:

    ```
    mkdir /tmp/tools
    ```

3.  Obtain the file  **openGauss-1.0.0-openEuler-64bit-Libpq.tar.gz**  from the  software installation package  and upload it to the  **/tmp/tools**  directory.

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >-   The software package is located where you put it before installation. Set it based on site requirements.  
    >-   The tool package name may vary in different OSs. Select the tool package suitable for your OS.  

4.  Run the following commands to decompress the package:

    ```
    cd /tmp/tools
    tar -zxvf openGauss-1.0.0-openEuler-64bit-Libpq.tar.gz
    ```

5.  Set environment variables.

    Run the following command to open the  **\~/.bashrc**  file:

    ```
    vi ~/.bashrc
    ```

    Enter the following content and run  **:wq!**  to save and exit.

    ```
    export PATH=/tmp/tools/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/tools/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```

6.  Run the following command to make the environment variables take effect:

    ```
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

7.  Connect to a database.

    After the database is installed, a database named  **postgres**  is generated by default. When connecting to a database for the first time, you can connect to this database.

    ```
    gsql -d postgres -h 10.10.0.11 -U jack -p 8000 -W Test@123
    ```

    **postgres**  is the name of the database,  **10.10.0.11**  is the IP address of the server where the primary node of the database resides,  **jack**  is the user of the database,  **8000**  is the port number of the CN, and  **Test@123**  is the password of user  **jack**.

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >-   If a machine connected to openGauss is not in the same network segment as openGauss, the IP address specified by  **-h**  should be the value of  **coo.cooListenIp2**  \(application access IP address\) set in Manager.  
    >-   Do not remotely connect to the database as user  **omm**.
