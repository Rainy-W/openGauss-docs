# Configuring Environment Variables<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0241496986"></a>

The environment variable configuration for compiling the openGauss has been written into the one-click compilation and packaging script. Therefore, you do not need to configure the environment variables.

If you do not want to use the one-click compilation script, you need to manually configure environment variables. For details, see  [Software Compilation and Installation](software-compilation-and-installation.md).
