# MOT Replication and High Availability<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0270171501"></a>

Since MOT is integrated into openGauss and uses/supports its replication and high availability, both synchronous and asynchronous replication are supported out of the box.

The openGauss gs\_ctl tool is used for availability control and to operate the cluster. This includes gs\_ctl switchover, gs\_ctl failover, gs\_ctl build and so on.

You may refer to the openGauss Tools Reference document for more information.

-   To configure replication and high availability â€“
