# MOT Resource Utilization<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0270171509"></a>

The following figure shows the resource utilization of the test performed on a x86 server with four sockets, 96 cores and 512GB RAM server. It demonstrates that a MOT table is able to efficiently and consistently consume almost all available CPU resources. For example, it shows that almost 100% CPU percentage utilization is achieved for 192 cores and 3.9M tpmC.

-   **tmpC –**  Number of TPC-C transactions completed per minute is represented by the orange bar and the  **tpmC**  Y axis on the left.
-   **CPU % Utilization –**  The amount of CPU utilization is represented by the blue line and the  **CPU %**  Y axis on the right.
