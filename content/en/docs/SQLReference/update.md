## Function<a name="en-us_topic_0283137651_en-us_topic_0237122194_en-us_topic_0059778969_s85747c5f88e64562a8ff9ddacda19929"></a>

**UPDATE**  updates data in a table.  **UPDATE**  changes the values of the specified columns in all rows that satisfy the condition. The  **WHERE**  clause clarifies conditions. The columns to be modified need to be mentioned in the  **SET**  clause; columns not explicitly modified retain their previous values.

## Precautions<a name="en-us_topic_0283137651_en-us_topic_0237122194_en-us_topic_0059778969_s7e9e912f472543cbb190edb83e5f22d2"></a>

-   The owner of a table, users granted with the  **UPDATE**  permission on the table, or users granted with the  **UPDATE ANY TABLE**  permission can update data in the table. The system administrator has the permission to update data in the table by default.
-   You must have the  **SELECT**  permission on all tables involved in the expressions or conditions.
-   For column-store tables, the  **RETURNING**  clause is currently not supported.
-   Column-store tables do not support non-deterministic update. If you update data in one row with multiple rows of data in a column-store table, an error will be reported.
-   Memory space that records update operations in column-store tables is not recycled. You need to clean it by executing  **VACUUM FULL table\_name**.
-   Currently,  **UPDATE**  cannot be used in column-store replication tables.
-   The syntax for updating multiple tables takes effect only when **sql\_compatibility** is set to **B**. Column-store tables, views, and tables containing RULE cannot be updated.

```
Update a single table:
[ WITH [ RECURSIVE ] with_query [, ...] ]
UPDATE [/*+ plan_hint */] [ ONLY ] table_name [ partition_clause ] [ * ] [ [ AS ] alias ]
SET {column_name = { expression | DEFAULT } 
    |( column_name [, ...] ) = {( { expression | DEFAULT } [, ...] ) |sub_query }}[, ...]
    [ FROM from_list] [ WHERE condition ]
    [ ORDER BY {expression [ [ ASC | DESC | USING operator ]
    [ LIMIT { count } ]
    [ RETURNING {* 
                | {output_expression [ [ AS ] output_name ]} [, ...] }];

Update multiple tables:
[ WITH [ RECURSIVE ] with_query [, ...] ]
UPDATE [/*+ plan_hint */] table_list
SET {column_name = { expression | DEFAULT } 
    |( column_name [, ...] ) = {( { expression | DEFAULT } [, ...] ) |sub_query }}[, ...]
    [ FROM from_list] [ WHERE condition ];

where sub_query can be:
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT [ ON ( expression [, ...] ) ] ]
{ * | {expression [ [ AS ] output_name ]} [, ...] }
[ FROM from_item [, ...] ]
[ WHERE condition ]
[ GROUP BY grouping_element [, ...] ]
[ HAVING condition [, ...] ]
[ ORDER BY {expression [ [ ASC | DESC | USING operator ] | nlssort_expression_clause ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ]} [, ...] ]
[ LIMIT { [offset,] count | ALL } ]
```
-   The subquery with\_query is as follows:

    ```
    with_query_name [ ( column_name [, ...] ) ]
        AS [ [ NOT ] MATERIALIZED ] ( {select | values | insert | update | delete} )
    ```

## Parameter Description<a name="en-us_topic_0283137651_en-us_topic_0237122194_en-us_topic_0059778969_sf3e3262b89854b3d829a94054116838c"></a>

-   **WITH \[ RECURSIVE \] with\_query \[, ...\]**

    Specifies one or more subqueries that can be referenced by name in the main query, which is equivalent to a temporary table.

    If **RECURSIVE** is specified, it allows a **SELECT** subquery to reference itself by name.

    The format of with\_query is as follows: with\_query\_name \[ \( column\_name \[, ...\] \) \] AS \[ \[ NOT \] MATERIALIZED \] \( \{select | values | insert | update | delete\} \)

    -   **with\_query\_name** specifies the name of the result set generated by a subquery. Such names can be used to access the result sets of subqueries in a query.
    -   **column\_name** specifies the column name displayed in the subquery result set.
    -   Each subquery can be a **SELECT**, **VALUES**, **INSERT**, **UPDATE** or **DELETE** statement.
    -   You can use **MATERIALIZED** or **NOT MATERIALIZED** to modify the CTE.
        -   If **MATERIALIZED** is specified, the WITH query will be materialized, and a copy of the subquery result set is generated. The copy is directly queried at the reference point. Therefore, the WITH subquery cannot be jointly optimized with the SELECT statement trunk (for example, predicate pushdown and equivalence class transfer). In this scenario, you can use **NOT MATERIALIZED** for modification. If the WITH query can be executed as a subquery inline, the preceding optimization can be performed.
        -   If the user does not explicitly declare the materialized attribute, comply with the following rules: If the CTE is referenced only once in the SELECT statement trunk to which it belongs and semantically supports inline execution, it will be rewritten as subquery inline execution. Otherwise, the materialized execution will be performed in CTE Scan mode.

-   **plan\_hint**  clause

    Follows the  **UPDATE**  keyword in the  **/\*+ \*/**  format. It is used to optimize the plan of an  **UPDATE**  statement block. For details, see  [Hint-based Tuning](en-us_topic_0289900289.md). In each statement, only the first  **/\*+** *plan\*hint _**\*/**  comment block takes effect as a hint. Multiple hints can be written.

-   **table\_name**

    Specifies the name \(optionally schema-qualified\) of the table to be updated.

    Value range: an existing table name

-   **partition\_clause**

    Updates a specified partition.

    PARTITION \{ \( partition\_name \) | FOR \( partition\_value \[, ...\] \) \} |

    SUBPARTITION \{ \( subpartition\_name \) | FOR \( subpartition\_value \[, ...\] \) \}

    For details about the keywords, see  [SELECT](select.md).

    For details, see  [CREATE TABLE SUBPARTITION](create-table-subpartition.md).

-   **alias**

    Specifies a substitute name for the target table.

    Value range: a string. It must comply with the identifier naming convention.

-   **table\_list**

    Specifies an expression list of a table. It is similar to from\_list, but can declare both the target table and associated table. It is used only in the syntax for updating multiple tables.

-   **column\_name**

    Specifies the name of the column to be modified.

    You can refer to this column by specifying the target table alias and the column name. Example:

    UPDATE foo AS f SET f.col\_name = 'namecol';

    Value range: an existing column

-   **expression**

    Specifies a value assigned to a column or an expression that assigns the value.

-   **DEFAULT**

    Specifies the default value of a column.

    The value is  **NULL**  if no specified default value has been assigned to it.

-   **sub\_query**

    Specifies a subquery.

    This statement can be executed to update a table with information for other tables in the same database. For details about clauses in the  **SELECT**  statement, see  [SELECT](select.md).

    When a single column is updated, the ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses can be used. When multiple columns are updated, the ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses cannot be used.

-   **from\_list**

    Specifies a list of table expressions, allowing columns from other tables to appear in the  **WHERE**  condition and the update expressions. This is similar to the list of tables that can be specified in the  **FROM**  clause of a  **SELECT**  statement.

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:** 
    >Note that the target table must not appear in the  **from\_list**, unless you intend a self-join \(in which case it must appear with an alias in the  **from\_list**\).

-   **condition**

    Specifies an expression that returns a value of type Boolean. Only rows for which this expression returns  **true**  are updated. You are not advised to use numeric types such as int for  **condition**, because such types can be implicitly converted to bool values \(non-zero values are implicitly converted to  **true**  and  **0**  is implicitly converted to  **false**\), which may cause unexpected results.

-   **ORDER BY**

    For details about the keywords, see [SELECT](select.md).

-   **LIMIT**

    For details about the keywords, see [SELECT](select.md).
    
-   **output\_expression**

    Specifies an expression to be computed and returned by the  **UPDATE**  statement after each row is updated.

    Value range: The expression can use any column names of the table named by  **table\_name**  or tables listed in  **FROM**. Write \* to return all columns.

-   **output\_name**

    Specifies a name to use for a returned column.
