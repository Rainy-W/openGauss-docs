# Stored Procedure<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0245374600"></a>

In openGauss, business rules and logics are saved as stored procedures.

A stored procedure is a combination of SQL and PL/SQL. Stored procedures can move the code that executes business rules from applications to databases. Therefore, the code storage can be used by multiple programs at a time.

For details about how to create and call a stored procedure, see  [CREATE PROCEDURE](create-procedure.md).

The application methods for PL/pgSQL functions mentioned in  [PL/pgSQL Functions](pl-pgsql-functions.md)  are similar to those for stored procedures. Unless otherwise specified, the following sections apply to stored procedures and PL/pgSQL functions.
