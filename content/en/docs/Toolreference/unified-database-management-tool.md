# Unified Database Management Tool<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000001246286999"></a>

The cluster manager \(CM\) is a database management module. It supports customized resource monitoring and provides capabilities such as monitoring of the primary/standby database status, network communication faults, file system faults, and automatic primary/standby switchover upon faults. It also provides various database management capabilities, such as starting and stopping nodes and instances, querying database instance status, performing primary/standby switchover, and managing logs. The capability of remotely querying and receiving cluster status through REST interfaces is also provided.

Note that in a scenario where there are one primary node and one standby node, the CM supports only basic capabilities, such as installation, startup, stop, and detection.
