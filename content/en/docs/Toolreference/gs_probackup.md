# gs\_probackup<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0289899221"></a>

## Background<a name="en-us_topic_0287276008_section779474172017"></a>

**gs\_probackup**  is a tool used to manage openGauss database backup and restoration. It periodically backs up the openGauss instances so that the server can be restored when the database is faulty.

-   It supports the physical backup of a standalone database or a primary node in a database.
-   It supports the backup of contents in external directories, such as script files, configuration files, log files, and dump files.
-   It supports incremental backup, periodic backup, and remote backup.
-   It supports settings on the backup retention policy.

## Prerequisites<a name="en-us_topic_0287276008_section95951827112520"></a>

-   The openGauss database can be connected.
-   To use PTRACK incremental backup, manually add  **enable\_cbm\_tracking = on**  to  **postgresql.conf**.

## Important Notes<a name="en-us_topic_0287276008_section6439171332614"></a>

-   The backup must be performed by the user who runs the database server.
-   The major version number of the database server to be backed up must be the same as that of the database server to be restored.
-   To back up a database in remote mode using SSH, install the database of the same major version on the local and remote hosts, and run the  **ssh-copy-id remote\_user@remote\_host**  command to set an SSH connection without a password between the local host backup user and the remote host database user.
-   In remote mode, only the subcommands  **add-instance**,  **backup**, and  **restore**  can be executed.
-   Before running the  **restore**  subcommand, stop the gaussdb process.

## Command Description<a name="en-us_topic_0287276008_section86861610172816"></a>

-   Print the  **gs\_probackup**  version.

    ```
    gs_probackup -V|--version
    gs_probackup version
    ```

-   Display brief information about the  **gs\_probackup**  command. Alternatively, display details about parameters of a specified subcommand of  **gs\_probackup**.

    ```
    gs_probackup -?|--help
    gs_probackup help [command]
    ```

-   Initialize the backup directory in  **backup-path**. The backup directory stores the contents that have been backed up. If the  **backup-path**  backup path exists, it must be empty.

    ```
    gs_probackup init -B backup-path [--help]
    ```

-   Initialize a new backup instance in the backup directory of  **backup-path**  and generate the  **pg\_probackup.conf**  configuration file, which saves the  **gs\_probackup **settings of the specified data directory  **pgdata-path**.

    ```
    gs_probackup add-instance -B backup-path -D pgdata-path --instance=instance_name
    [-E external-directories-paths]
    [remote_options]
    [--help]
    ```

-   Delete the backup content related to the specified instance from the  **backup-path**  directory.

    ```
    gs_probackup del-instance -B backup-path --instance=instance_name
    [--help]
    ```

-   Add the specified connection, compression, and log-related settings to the  **pg\_probackup.conf**  configuration file or modify the existing settings. You are not advised to manually edit the  **pg\_probackup.conf**  configuration file.

    ```
    gs_probackup set-config -B backup-path --instance=instance_name
    [-D pgdata-path] [-E external-directories-paths] [--archive-timeout=timeout]
    [--retention-redundancy=retention-redundancy] [--retention-window=retention-window] [--wal-depth=wal-depth]
    [--compress-algorithm=compress-algorithm] [--compress-level=compress-level]

    [logging_options] [remote_options]
    [--help]
    ```

-   Add the backup-related settings to the  **backup.control**  configuration file or modify the settings.

    ```
    gs_probackup set-backup -B backup-path --instance=instance_name -i backup-id
    [--note=text] [pinning_options]
    [--help]
    ```

-   Display the content of the  **pg\_probackup.conf**  configuration file in the backup directory. You can specify  **--format=json**  to display the information in JSON format. By default, the plain text format is used.

    ```
    gs_probackup show-config -B backup-path --instance=instance_name
    [--format=plain|json]
    [--help]
    ```

-   Display the contents of the backup directory. If  **instance\_name**  and  **backup\_id**  are specified, detailed information about the backup is displayed. You can specify  **--format=json**  to display the information in JSON format. By default, the plain text format is used.

    ```
    gs_probackup show -B backup-path
    [--instance=instance_name [-i backup-id]] [--archive] [--format=plain|json]
    [--help]
    ```

-   Create a backup for a specified database instance.

    ```
    gs_probackup backup -B backup-path --instance=instance_name -b backup-mode
    [-D pgdata-path] [-C] [-S slot-name] [--temp-slot] [--backup-pg-log] [-j threads_num] [--progress]
    [--no-validate] [--skip-block-validation] [-E external-directories-paths] [--no-sync] [--note=text]
    [--archive-timeout=timeout]
    [logging_options] [retention_options] [compression_options]
    [connection_options] [remote_options] [pinning_options]
    [--help]
    ```

-   Restore a specified instance from the backup copy in the  **backup-path**  directory. If an instance to be restored is specified,  **gs\_probackup**  will look for its latest backup and restore it to the specified recovery target. Otherwise, the latest backup of any instance is used.

    ```
    gs_probackup restore -B backup-path --instance=instance_name
    [-D pgdata-path] [-i backup_id] [-j threads_num] [--progress] [--force] [--no-sync] [--no-validate] [--skip-block-validation]
    [--external-mapping=OLDDIR=NEWDIR] [-T OLDDIR=NEWDIR] [--skip-external-dirs] [-I incremental_mode]
    [recovery_options] [remote_options] [logging_options]
    [--help]
    ```

-   Merge all incremental backups between the specified incremental backup and its parent full backup into the parent full backup. The parent full backup will receive all merged data, while the merged incremental backup will be deleted as redundancy.

    ```
    gs_probackup merge -B backup-path --instance=instance_name -i backup_id
    [-j threads_num] [--progress] [logging_options]
    [--help]
    ```

-   Delete a specified backup or delete backups that do not meet the current retention policy.

    ```
    gs_probackup delete -B backup-path --instance=instance_name
    [-i backup-id | --delete-expired | --merge-expired | --status=backup_status]
    [--delete-wal] [-j threads_num] [--progress]
    [--retention-redundancy=retention-redundancy] [--retention-window=retention-window]
    [--wal-depth=wal-depth] [--dry-run]
    [logging_options]
    [--help]
    ```

-   Verify that all files required for restoring the database exist and are not damaged. If  **instance\_name **is not specified,  **gs\_probackup **verifies all available backups in the backup directory. If  **instance\_name **is specified and no additional options are specified,  **gs\_probackup **verifies all available backups for this backup instance. If both  **instance\_name **and  **backup-id **or recovery objective-related options are specified,  **gs\_probackup **checks whether these options can be used to restore the database.

    ```
    gs_probackup validate -B backup-path
    [--instance=instance_name] [-i backup-id]
    [-j threads_num] [--progress] [--skip-block-validation]
    [--recovery-target-time=time | --recovery-target-xid=xid | --recovery-target-lsn=lsn | --recovery-target-name=target-name]
    [--recovery-target-inclusive=boolean]
    [logging_options]
    [--help] 
    ```

    Skips block-level verification to speed up verification. During the automatic verification before the restoration, only file-level verification is performed.

-   --no-validate

    Skips the backup verification.

-   --force

    Specifies the invalid state that allows ignoring backup. This flag can be used if data needs to be restored from a damaged or invalid backup. Exercise caution when using it.


**Recovery objective-related parameters \(recovery\_options\)**

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
>Currently, continuous WAL archiving PITR cannot be configured. Therefore, parameter usage is restricted as follows:
>To use continuously archived WAL logs for PITR, perform the following steps:
>1.  Replace the target database directory with the physical backup files.
>2.  Delete all files in the database directory  **pg\_xlog/**.
>3.  Copy the archived WAL log file to the  **pg\_xlog**  file. \(Or you can configure  **restore\_command**  in the  **recovery.conf**  file to skip this step.\)
>4.  Create the recovery command file  **recovery.conf**  in the database directory and specify the database recovery degree.
>5.  Start the database.
>6.  Connect to the database and check whether the database is recovered to the expected status. If the expected status is reached, run the  **pg\_xlog\_replay\_resume\(\)**  command so that the primary node can provide services externally.

>To exclude certain backups from the established retention policy, you can use the following parameters with the  **backup**  and  **set-backup**  commands.

-   --ttl=_interval_

    Specifies a fixed amount of time to back up data from the restoration time. The value must be a positive integer. The value  **0**  indicates that the backup is canceled.

    Supported unit: ms, s, min, h, d \(default value:  **s**\)

    For example,  **--ttl=30d**.

-   --expire-time=_time_

    Specifies the timestamp when the backup is invalid. The time stamp must comply with the ISO-8601 standard.

    For example,  **--expire-time='2020-01-01 00:00:00+03'**.


**Log-related parameters \(logging\_options\)**

Log levels:  **verbose**,  **log**,  **info**,  **warning**,  **error**, and  **off**.

-   --log-level-console=_log-level-console_

    Sets the level of logs to be sent to the console. Each level contains all the levels following it. A higher level indicates fewer messages sent. If this parameter is set to  **off**, the log recording function of the console is disabled.

    Default value:  **info**

-   --log-level-file=_log-level-file_

    Sets the level of logs to be sent to the log file. Each level contains all the levels following it. A higher level indicates fewer messages sent. If this parameter is set to  **off**, the log file recording function is disabled.

    Default value:  **off**

-   --log-filename=_log-filename_

    Specifies the name of the log file to be created. The file name can use the strftime mode. Therefore,  **%-escapes**  can be used to specify the file name that changes with time.

    For example, if the  **pg\_probackup-%u.log**  mode is specified, pg\_probackup generates a log file each day of the week, with  **%u**  replaced by the corresponding decimal number, that is,  **pg\_probackup-1.log**  indicates Monday.  **pg\_probackup-2.log**  indicates Tuesday, and so on.

    This parameter is valid if the  **--log-level-file**  parameter is specified to enable log file recording.

    Default value:  **"pg\_probackup.log"**

-   --error-log-filename=_error-log-filename_

    Default value:  **$BACKUP\_PATH/log**

-   --log-rotation-size=_log-rotation-size_

    Specifies the maximum size of a log file. If the maximum size is reached, the log file will be circulated after the  **gs\_probackup**  command is executed. The  **help**  and  **version**  commands will not lead to a log file circulation. The value  **0**  indicates that the file size-based loop is disabled.

    The unit can be KB, MB, GB, or TB. The default unit is  **KB**.

    Default value:  **0**

-   --log-rotation-age=_log-rotation-age_

    Maximum life cycle of a log file. If the maximum size is reached, the log file will be circulated after the  **gs\_probackup**  command is executed. The  **help**  and  **version**  commands will not lead to a log file circulation. The  **$BACKUP\_PATH/log/log\_rotation**  directory saves the time of the last created log file. The value  **0**  indicates that the time-based loop is disabled.

    Supported unit: ms, s, min, h, d \(default value:  **min**\)

    Default value:  **0**

    >```


## Backup Process<a name="en-us_topic_0287276008_section1735727125216"></a>

1.  Initialize the backup directory. Create the  **backups/**  and  **wal/**  subdirectories in the specified directory to store backup files and WAL files respectively.

    ```
    gs_probackup init -B backup_dir
    ```

2.  Add a new backup instance. gs\_probackup can store backups of multiple database instances in the same backup directory.

    ```
    gs_probackup add-instance -B backup_dir -D data_dir --instance instance_name
    ```

3.  Create a backup for a specified database instance. Before performing an incremental backup, you must create at least one full backup.

    ```
    gs_probackup backup -B backup_dir --instance instance_name -b backup_mode
    ```

4.  Restore data from the backup of a specified DB instance.

    ```
    gs_probackup restore -B backup_dir --instance instance_name -D pgdata-path -i backup_id
    ```
