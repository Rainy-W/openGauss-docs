# gs\_probackup<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0283839027"></a>

## Background<a name="section779474172017"></a>

**gs\_probackup**  is a tool used to manage openGauss database backup and restoration. It periodically backs up the openGauss instances so that the server can be restored when the database is faulty.

-   It supports the physical backup of a standalone database or a primary database node in a cluster.
-   It supports the backup of contents in external directories, such as script files, configuration files, log files, and dump files.
-   It supports incremental backup, periodic backup, and remote backup.
-   It supports settings on the backup retention policy.

## Prerequisites<a name="section95951827112520"></a>

-   The openGauss database can be connected.
-   The parameter  **enable\_cbm\_tracking = on**  is manually added to the  **postgresql.conf**  file.

## Important Notes<a name="section6439171332614"></a>

-   The backup must be performed by the user who runs the database server. For example, if the database server is run by user  **postgres**, the backup must be performed by user  **postgres**. If the backup is performed in remote mode through SSH, the value of  **--remote-user**  must be  **postgres**.
-   The major version number of the database server to be backed up must be the same as that of the database server to be restored.
-   To back up a database in remote mode using SSH, install the database of the same major version on the local and remote hosts, and run the  **ssh-copy-id remote\_user@remote\_host**  command to set an SSH connection without a password between the local host backup user and the remote host database user.
-   In remote mode, only the subcommands  **add-instance**,  **backup**, and  **restore**  can be executed.

## Command Description<a name="section86861610172816"></a>

>If continuous WAL archiving is configured, the following parameters can be used together with the  **restore**  command.

-   --recovery-target=immediate|latest

    Defines when to stop the recovery.

    **immediate**: When the consistency status of the specified backup is reached, the restoration stops. If the  **-i/--backup\_id**  parameter is omitted, the restoration stops after the latest available backup is restored.

    **latest**: Data is continuously restored until all available WAL segments in all archives are applied.

    The default value of  **--recovery-target**  depends on the WAL transmission mode of the backup to be restored. Set the backup mode of the streaming backup to  **immediate**  and the archive mode to  **latest**.

    Merges the oldest incremental backup that meets the retention policy requirements with its expired parent backup.

-   --dry-run

    Displays the current status of all available backups. Expired backups will not be deleted or merged.


**Parameters for fixed backup**

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
>To exclude certain backups from the established retention policy, you can use the following parameters with the  **backup**  and  **set-backup**  commands.

-   --ttl=ttl

    Specifies a fixed amount of time to back up data from the restoration time. The value must be a positive integer. The value  **0**  indicates that the backup is canceled.

    Supported unit: ms, s, min, h, d \(default value:  **s**\)

    For example,  **--ttl=30d**.

-   --expire-time=time

    Specifies the timestamp when the backup is invalid. The time stamp must comply with the ISO-8601 standard.

    For example,  **--expire-time='2020-01-01 00:00:00+03'**.


**Parameters for log**

Log levels:  **verbose**,  **log**,  **info**,  **warning**,  **error**, and  **off**.

-   --log-level-console=log\_level

    Sets the level of logs to be sent to the console. Each level contains all the levels following it. A higher level indicates fewer messages sent. If this parameter is set to  **off**, the log recording function of the console is disabled.

    Default value:  **info**

-   --log-level-file=log\_level

    Sets the level of logs to be sent to the log file. Each level contains all the levels following it. A higher level indicates fewer messages sent. If this parameter is set to  **off**, the log file recording function is disabled.

-   --log-filename=log\_filename

    Specifies the name of the log file to be created. The file name can use the strftime mode. Therefore,  **%-escapes**  can be used to specify the file name that changes with time.

    For example, if the  **pg\_probackup-%u.log**  mode is specified, pg\_probackup generates a log file each day of the week, with  **%u**  replaced by the corresponding decimal number, that is,  **pg\_probackup-1.log**  indicates Monday.  **pg\_probackup-2.log**  indicates Tuesday, and so on.

    This parameter is valid if the  **--log-level-file**  parameter is specified to enable log file recording.

    Default value:  **pg\_probackup.log**

-   --error-log-filename=error\_log\_filename

    Specifies the name of the log file that is used only for error logs. The specifying method is the same as that of the  **--log-filename**  parameter.

    It is used for troubleshooting and monitoring.

    Specifies the directory where log files are created. The value must be an absolute path. This directory is created when the first log is written.

    Default value:  **$BACKUP\_PATH/log/**

-   --log-rotation-size=log\_rotation\_size

    Specifies the maximum size of a log file. If the maximum size is reached, the log file will be circulated after the  **gs\_probackup**  command is executed. The  **help**  and  **version**  commands will not lead to a log file circulation. The value  **0**  indicates that the file size-based loop is disabled.

    The unit can be KB, MB, GB, or TB. The default unit is  **KB**.

    Default value:  **0**

-   --log-rotation-age=log\_rotation\_age

    Maximum life cycle of a log file. If the maximum size is reached, the log file will be circulated after the  **gs\_probackup**  command is executed. The  **help**  and  **version**  commands will not lead to a log file circulation. The  **$BACKUP\_PATH/log/log\_rotation**  directory saves the time of the last created log file. The value  **0**  indicates that the time-based loop is disabled.

    Supported unit: ms, s, min, h, d \(default value:  **min**\)

    Default value:  **0**


**Parameters for connection**

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
>The following parameters can be used together with the  **backup**  command.

-   -d dbname, --pgdatabase=dbname

    Specifies the name of the database to connect to. This connection is only used to manage the backup process. Therefore, you can connect to any existing database. If this parameter is not specified in the command line, the  _PGDATABASE_  environment variable, or the  **pg\_probackup.conf**  configuration file, gs\_probackup attempts to obtain the value from the  _PGUSER_  environment variable. If the  _PGUSER_  variable is not set, the value is obtained from the current user name.

    System environment variable:  _$PGDATABASE_

-   -h host, --pghost=host

    Specifies the host name of the system on which the server is running. If the value begins with a slash \(/\), it is used as the directory for the UNIX domain socket.

    System environment variable:  _$PGHOST_

    Default value:  **local socket**

-   -p port, --pgport=port

    Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file name extension on which the server is listening for connections.

    Specifies the username of the host to be connected.

    System environment variable:  _$PGUSER_

-   -w, --no-password

    Never issues a password prompt. The connection attempt fails if the host requires password verification and the password is not provided in other ways. This parameter is useful in batch jobs and the scripts that require no user password.

-   -W, --password

    Forcibly issues a password prompt.


**Parameters for compression**

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**

## Backup Process<a name="section1735727125216"></a>

1.  Initialize the backup directory. Create the  **backups/**  and  **wal/**  subdirectories in the specified directory to store backup files and WAL files respectively.

    ```
    gs_probackup init -B backup_dir
    ```

2.  Add a new backup instance. gs\_probackup can store backups of multiple database instances in the same backup directory.

    ```
    gs_probackup add-instance -B backup_dir -D data_dir --instance instance_name [remote_options]
    ```

3.  Create a backup for a specified database instance. Before performing an incremental backup, you must create at least one full backup.

    ```
    gs_probackup backup -B backup_dir --instance instance_name -b backup_mode
    ```

4.  Restore data from the backup of a specified DB instance.

    ```
    gs_probackup restore -B backup_dir --instance instance_name -i backup_id
    ```
