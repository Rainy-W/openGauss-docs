**gs\_ssh**, provided by openGauss, helps users run the same command on multiple nodes in openGauss.

## Precautions

- **gs_ssh** can only run the command which the OS user **omm** has permission
- The commands executed by gs_ssh do not affect the current session. For example, the cd or source command affects only the process environment, but does not affect the current session environment.

## Prerequisites<a name="en-us_topic_0237152344_en-us_topic_0059777951_sa146d07733084d8292706efa87117d57"></a>

-   The trust relationship among the hosts is normal.
-   openGauss has been correctly installed and deployed.
-   The command to be run can be found by the  **which **command, and the current user has the required execution permission.
-   Log in to the OS as the OS user  **omm**  to run the  **gs\_ssh**  command.
