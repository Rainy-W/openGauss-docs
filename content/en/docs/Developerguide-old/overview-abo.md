Intelligent cardinality estimation uses the Bayesian network model in the database to model the association and distribution of multi-column data samples, so as to provide more accurate cardinality estimation for multi-column equality queries. More accurate cardinality estimation can significantly improve the accuracy of the optimizer's selection of plans and operators, thereby improving the overall throughput of the database.
